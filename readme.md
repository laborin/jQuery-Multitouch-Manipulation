# jQuery Multitouch Manipulation

Tired of having to use the different jQueryUI components for every kind of manipulation? With this plugin you can manipulate any DOM element with realistic multitouch gestures: dragging, scaling and rotating, all at the same time. Element should have "position:absolute" style for this code to work.
